These are my solutions to advent of code 2022
I purposeley tried to do all of this in powershell for the experience.


Check out adventofcode at www.adventofcode.com

Special Note, if you are getting errors, it is likely due to powershellisms. If you strong type a variable, for assurity of code functionality. That's a good thing, but powershell doesn't ever change that variable unless you do some things like remove the variable etc...

What i mean is, reset your environment for a new script run to rule out strong typed variables
